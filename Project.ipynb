    "# Harry Styles Quiz\n",
    "##### By Thi Nguyen\n",
    "This project creates a bot that will ask 10 multiple choice questions relating to the singer Harry Styles in order to guess if the user is a Harry Styles fan or not. The user will start the quiz by typing in \"start\" or \"begin\" to execute the quiz. For each question answered correctly, +1 will be added to a counter set to 0. If the user selects anything but \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\", they will be asked to select a correct input. When the quiz is completed and the counter is less than 5, the user is most likely not a Harry Styles fan. If the counter is equal to 5 or greater, they are probably a Harry Styles fan."
